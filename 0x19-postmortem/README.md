Systems are meant to fail, but how organizations respond to these failures defines their resilience. Postmortems, structured analyses conducted after operational failures, play a crucial role in this response. By dissecting failures, identifying root causes, and implementing preventive measures, teams turn setbacks into opportunities for learning and improvement. Postmortems foster accountability, transparency, and a blame-free culture, enabling teams to openly discuss failures and collaborate on solutions. They also mitigate risks by proactively addressing weaknesses in systems and processes. Ultimately, postmortems promote a culture of learning, innovation, and continuous improvement, ensuring greater reliability and success within organizations.

Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM GMT.
Impact: The HAProxy service was down, leading to service disruptions for all incoming traffic routed through the load balancer. Users experienced intermittent connectivity issues and slow response times during this period. Approximately 30% of users were affected by the outage.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as port conflict. The port 80, crucial for the HAProxy service, was already in use by another program, namely the Nginx server.
Timeline:
10:00 AM GMT: Issue detected when monitoring alerts indicated HAProxy service failures.
10:05 AM GMT: Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting misconfigurations or network problems.
10:30 AM GMT: After thorough investigation, it was discovered that port 80 was occupied by Nginx, conflicting with HAProxy's operation.
10:45 AM GMT: Misleadingly, engineers initially explored HAProxy configurations and server logs, overlooking port conflicts.
11:00 AM GMT: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further assistance.
11:30 AM GMT: DevOps team identified the port conflict as the root cause of the issue.
12:00 PM GMT: Resolution plan devised to reconfigure Nginx to use an alternative port.
12:30 PM GMT: Nginx reconfiguration implemented, freeing port 80 for HAProxy usage.
1:00 PM GMT : HAProxy service successfully started, and normal traffic routing resumed.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The presence of Nginx server occupying port 80 caused a conflict, preventing HAProxy from starting.
Resolution: Nginx server configuration was adjusted to utilize a different port, allowing HAProxy to occupy port 80 without conflicts.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance port conflict detection mechanisms during service startup.
Implement stricter port allocation policies to avoid conflicts.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Patch Nginx server configuration to use an alternative port.
Implement automated checks for port availability during service startup.
Conduct regular audits to identify and resolve port conflicts across the infrastructure.
In conclusion, the outage was promptly resolved by identifying and rectifying the port conflict between HAProxy and Nginx. Moving forward, implementing automated checks and stricter port allocation policies will mitigate similar issues, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery to users.
